# Sales Drop Warnings Feature

A feature that tracks sales of each product at least once a month. Compares to previous months and years to identify its sales performance. The report can be generated as a PDF document and sent over email to one of the boards email addresses or as a brief summary message over WhatsApp.

It is important to understand the specifics of the products. Some products are sold individually while others usually sold as part of a bundle.
