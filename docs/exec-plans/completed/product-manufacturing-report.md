# Priduct manufacturing report

This report should share similar design and UX patters as report-employee-performance however instead on employee focus it should focus on the product.

- similar filters, employee, date start, date end, work type.
- table with list of all products manufactured based on seleected filters
    first column product name
    second column total number of work quantity 
    third column total time of work allocated

It is great to sort products alphabetically. A separate API route on a server side might be needed here.
